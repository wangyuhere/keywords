Description
--

Keywords is a hobby research project which is used to analyze words occurrences in articles.

The purposes of this project are to:
* Know the common words
* Get the word trends by day
* Generate some keywords by day
* To do some natural language processing experiments
* Maybe to learn a foreigh language

The original idea of this project is that I want to learn Swedish and want to know which words to learn first.
As a software enginner, I would like to learn Swedish by Data Mining :)

Want to have a look how it works for Swedish, go to [http://keywords.wangyuhere.com](http://keywords.wangyuhere.com)
